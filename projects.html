                                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                                            <p>This was the first main project that I decided to do outside of school. At the time, I only had a high school level of skill in terms of coding, even though my interest in computer science far surpassed that. As a result, I wanted to create a project 
                                            that improved both my coding skills and my overall understanding of computer science. So, I decided to re-create my favourite game, chess, but with the catch of it being online. With chess being a complicated game, and networking being no easy feat, this project would push me in the right direction toward understanding computer science at a higher level.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                                            <p> While I knew how to play chess, making chess was a completely different story. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to figuring out the valid moves a piece can have depending on its class and colour. Not only this, but I also had difficulty in implementing "check" into the game, a situation where a player's king is being attacked. I couldn't create an efficient way to calculate the valid moves if a player was in check. Lastly, I had no knowledge of networking, so it was extremely hard for me to understand how to implement an online feature.</p>
                                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                                            <p> It soon became obvious that my high school level of computer science would not suffice in order to complete this project. So, I decided to completely restart, deleting everything that I had so far. I decided to completely change my methodology for creating projects. Instead of hacking away at code, and hoping something will work, I decided to really evaluate the problem at hand. I really thought about what tools will I actually need in order to complete this project efficiently. As a result, I began researching computer science and networking tools. This led me into discovering Object Oriented Programming and the idea of a server and client. After understanding these topics, I was able to create my project in an efficient manner.

                                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                                            <p> Feeling good from completing my OnlineChess project, I wanted to keep the momentum going and use more object-oriented programming. This time, I decided to re-create a game I've never played, Tetris. As I've never played Tetris, I had to understand how the game worked before I actually started the project. I put myself at a disadvantage in order to challenge myself, while still improving my understanding of the concepts I learned in my OnlineChess project.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                                            <p>This time, I didn't have trouble with the coding aspect of the game, but instead the math. Specifically, rotating pieces was quite a challenge. While I could visualize how the piece would rotate, I had a hard time translating that into mathematical terms.</p>
                                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                                            <p>As I said, I could visualize how a piece would rotate. So, I decided to actually write down the coordinates, and see how exactly they would change depending on the rotation. I then did this for every single piece. From this, I was able to see a pattern, and after a few attempts, I was able to create a mathematical algorithm that described rotating a piece. All I had to do then was code it.</p>

                                            <h3>The Idea</h3>
                                        <p>  After completing both Chess and Tetris, I wanted to show what I learned from classes and objects. I didn't want to create something challenging, as I just wanted to practice this concept. So, I decided to create FlappyBird, a simple game that would refine my overall skill as a programmer.</p>
                                            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                                            <p> didn't have any notable difficulties with this particular project, however, I had a little trouble making the game go on for an infinite amount of time. Specifically, constantly creating pipes that would be different sizes, and making sure the bird would always be moving at a constant speed on the x-axis.</p>
                                            
                                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                                                <p>
                                                  This was an easy fix, as I would just check how many pipes were on the screen. If there was only one, I would just add one more. 
                                                </p>

                                                <p> Being always interested in search engines, such as Google, so I began looking into web scraping. I soon realized that anybody could web scrape, not just big companies like Google. At the same time, I was looking into APIs, specifically the Discord API. I decided to combine these two ideas and create a Discord Bot that would scrape information from a website. I took this a step further by making it so that a user could ask for specific information from the bot. The bot would then present this information in a clean format.</p>
                                                <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                                                <p> As I've never used an API or web-scraped, I had trouble implementing these concepts in code. A common problem I had was that I would implement something, and it would work, but I didn't truly understand why it was working. This caused other problems, as every time I tried to manipulate the code, I wouldn't manipulate it correctly as I didn't understand it. </p>
                                                <h3>Solution</h3>

                                                    Similar to my Chess project, I decided to take a step back, and research more in-depth what exactly I was doing. I used many resources, such as Youtube, books, and various websites. After learning what it actually meant to scrape the web, I tweaked my code to create a proper web scraper.

                                                <p> If you've seen my About Me page, you'll know that I'm interested in the Math of computer science. Algorithms are an integeral part of computer science, and how it connects with Math. I decided to look into algorithms, leading me to dijkstra's algorithm. After reading about it, I decided to test my knowledge by creating a pathfinder.  </p>
                                                <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                                                <p> Having understood how to approach projects like these, a project where I don't have experience with a certain concept, I made sure to take my time, and really understand the algorithm. As a result, I had minimal difficulties creating this project. However, I did have difficulty setting up the heap priority queue correctly. Since the walls were user-generated, I couldn't predict which cells, or nodes, were actual valid cells.</p> 
                                                <h3>Solution</h3>
                                                    <p>
                                                        My solution was Hashmaps. This project taught me how useful and important Hashmaps are. With a Hashmap, I was easily able to see if a cell was either a valid cell or a wall. From this, I was able to efficiently check which neighbours to check, and what cells are valid.     </p>
