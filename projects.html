                                            <p>This was the first main project that I decided to do outside of school. At the time, I only had a high school level of skill in terms of coding, even though my interest in computer science far surpassed that. As a result, I wanted to create a project 
                                                that improved both my coding skills and my overall understanding of computer science. So, I decided to re-create my favourite game, chess, but with the catch of it being online. With chess being a complicated game, and networking being no easy feat, this project would push me in the right direction toward understanding computer science at a higher level.

                                            <p> While I knew how to play chess, making chess was a completely different story. I ran into a lot of issues when it came to figuring out the valid moves a piece can have depending on its class and colour. Not only this, but I also had difficulty in implementing "check" into the game, a situation where a player's king is being attacked. I couldn't create an efficient way to calculate the valid moves if a player was in check. Lastly, I had no knowledge of networking, so it was extremely hard for me to understand how to implement an online feature.</p>

                                            <p> It soon became obvious that my high school level of computer science would not suffice in order to complete this project. So, I decided to completely restart, deleting everything that I had so far. I decided to completely change my methodology for creating projects. Instead of hacking away at code, and hoping something will work, I decided to really evaluate the problem at hand. I really thought about what tools will I actually need in order to complete this project efficiently. As a result, I began researching computer science and networking tools. This led me into discovering Object Oriented Programming and the idea of a server and client. After understanding these topics, I was able to create my project in an efficient manner.

Algorithms are an integral part of computer science, and how it connects with Math. I decided to look into algorithms, leading me to Dijkstra's algorithm. After reading about it, I decided to test my knowledge by creating an algorithm that finds the fastest path from a randomly generated maze. While creating the project, I decided to also make it so a user could try and solve the maze. This idea evolved into me creating a score for the user, where the score depended on how accurate the user's path was compared to the fastest. Not only this, I decided to link a database, so it saved your personal score, even if you closed the program. Lastly, I made it so you can view the top 5 global scores set in the game. This project taught me  about databases and gave me a deeper insight into backend programming</p>  </div>

                                            <p> Being always interested in search engines, such as Google, so I began looking into web scraping. I soon realized that anybody could web scrape, not just big companies like Google. At the same time, I was looking into APIs, specifically the Discord API. I decided to combine these two ideas and create a Discord Bot that would scrape information from a website. I took this a step further by making it so that a user could ask for specific information from the bot. The bot would then present this information in a clean format.</p>

This caused other problems, as every time I tried to manipulate the code, I wouldn't manipulate it correctly as I didn't understand it. </p>

I used many resources, such as Youtube, books, and various websites. After learning what it actually meant to scrape the web, I tweaked my code to create a proper web scraper.

This time, I decided to re-create a game I've never played, Tetris. As I've never played Tetris, I had to understand how the game worked before I actually started the project. I put myself at a disadvantage in order to challenge myself, while still improving my understanding of the concepts I learned in my OnlineChess project.

From this, I was able to see a pattern, and after a few attempts, I was able to create a mathematical algorithm that described rotating a piece. All I had to do then was code it.</p>
